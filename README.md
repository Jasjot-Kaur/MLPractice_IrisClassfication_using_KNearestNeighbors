# MLPractice_IrisClassfication_using_KNearestNeighbors
#### ML Practice

Classifying flowers of iris dataset using KNeighborsClassifier. That dataset includes 150 samples, each representing one of three species of iris. Each row contains four measurements – sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all in centimeters – plus a label: 0 for setosa, 1 for versicolor, and 2 for virginica. 
Below is an example of each species along with labels showing the difference between petals and sepals.
